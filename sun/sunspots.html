    <h2 class="highlight" style="text-align: center;">The Dawn of a New Era</h2> 

   <p style="text-align: justify;" > This story begins in the Netherlands on October 2, 1608,
     when Hans Lipperhey, a German optician naturalized in the Netherlands,
    filed a patent for his design of the telescope—an instrument that would soon spread across Europe,
    revolutionizing astronomical observation and paving the way for numerous sensational discoveries.
    Two years later, in 1610, Thomas Harriot and Galileo Galilei began the scientific study of the Sun
    using the telescope, observing sunspots for the first time. Thomas Harriot, an English astronomer,
    mathematician, and ethnographer, made his first observations of sunspots in December 1610 but never
    published his findings.
    Galileo Galilei, the renowned astronomer, philosopher, mathematician, and father of modern science,
    acquired one of the first telescopes, made significant improvements to it, and dedicated himself
    to observing celestial bodies. He began a systematic study of the Sun and its sunspots, laying 
    the foundation for modern solar astronomy.
        <!-- Galileo osserva per la prima volta le macchie solari nel Giugno
        del 1610 a Padova, ma solo nel 1611 durante il suo soggiorno a Roma, tra il mese
        di Marzo e Maggio, rese pubblica la sua scoperta.-->

             better known by his Latinized name, Fabricius.</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, on June 13, 1611, Johannes Fabricius published <em>De Maculis in Sole observatis, et apparente
         earum cum Sole conversione Narratio </em> (Narration on the Spots Observed on the Sun and Their 
         Apparent Rotation with the Sun), the first official document discussing sunspots.
         Fabricius, an astronomer born in Lower Saxony in 1587, studied in Leiden, the Netherlands, 
         where he became acquainted with the earliest telescopes. In March 1611, back in Osteel, Germany,
         he began observing the Sun through a telescope with the assistance of his father. To his surprise,
        he noticed that the Sun was spotted. Observations made over the following months allowed him to 
        understand that these spots were not fixed or permanent. They moved across the solar surface,
        disappearing from one side and reappearing on the other, revealing that our star rotates on its
        own axis.</p>

</div>


     <p style="text-align: justify;"> The following years, 1612 and 1613, proved to be crucial. 
        In January 1612, the Jesuit Christoph Scheiner published <em>Tres Epistolae de Maculis Solaribus
        Scriptae ad Marcum Welserum</em> (“Three Letters on Solar Spots Written to Marc Welser”).
        A year later, in <em>Istoria e dimostrazioni intorno alle macchie solari</em> 
        (“History and Demonstrations Concerning Sunspots”), Galileo Galilei published letters announcing
        the discovery of dark spots on the Sun’s surface. These two works are fundamental, yet they 
        offered very different explanations for the sunspots observed. Scheiner, a Jesuit faithful to 
        the prevailing theories about the Sun’s immutability, interpreted the spots as shadows cast by 
        small satellite bodies orbiting very close to the Sun—though he would later revise his views in 
        his monumental Rosa Ursina (1630). Galileo, on the other hand, quickly understood that the spots
        were real features of the Sun itself, variable and present on or near its surface, even if he 
        could not fully explain them. For the Pisan scientist, these were flat clouds clinging to the 
        Sun’s surface, and by observing their constant movement, he deduced that the Sun must rotate on
        its axis at a uniform speed.</p>

        <figcaption  style="text-align: justify;" >The letters to Marc Welser, published in <em>Istoria e dimostrazioni intorno alle macchie solari 
            e loro accidenti</em> (“History and Demonstrations Concerning Sunspots and Their Phenomena”), announce the
            discovery of dark spots on the Sun’s surface. From observing these spots, Galileo deduced that the 
            Sun rotates on its axis. The work includes numerous engravings illustrating the positions of the 
            sunspots on the solar surface.

        <img src="../img/scheiner_tavola_r.jpg" alt="scheiner_tavola" />
        <figcaption  style="text-align: justify;" >Scheiner aimed to preserve the perceived perfection of the Sun and the heavens, 
            and therefore argued that sunspots were satellites of the Sun. They appear as dark spots when passing 
            in front of the Sun but become invisible at other points in their orbits. The figure shows Scheiner’s 
            drawings of sunspots from <em>Tres Epistolae de Maculis Solaribus Scriptae ad Marcum Welserum</em>,
            published in 1612.

        <figcaption style="text-align: justify;">In the summer of 1612, Galileo conducted a series of observations of sunspots, 
            later published in <em>Istoria e Dimostrazioni Intorno Alle Macchie Solari e Loro Accidenti</em> (1613). 
            This figure shows his observations from June 2 to July 4, at intervals of approximately seven days.

    <h2 class="highlight"  style="text-align: center;">Before the Advent of the Telescope</h2>

    <p>But let’s take a step back: what was the situation before 1600?</p> 


    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The earliest known observation of sunspots is attributed to Theophrastus, a student of Aristotle, 
        and dates back to the 4th century BCE. Numerous sunspot observations were also recorded in Chinese,
        Japanese, and Korean annals. In Western literature, however, references to such observations are rare, 
        likely due to the influence of Aristotelian prejudice—later adopted by Christian theology—regarding an 
        immutable and incorruptible celestial world. Interestingly, almost all of the few sunspot observations
        made in the West before the introduction of the telescope were interpreted as the transits of Venus, 
        Mercury, or other supposed planets, called “inframercurial,” thought to exist between Mercury and the
        Sun.</p>
  <figure>
        <img src="../img/sunspot_Chronicles.jpg" alt="Disegno di una macchia solare nelle Cronache di Giovanni di Worcester" />
        <figcaption style="text-align: justify;" >Drawing of a sunspot in the Chronicles of John of
             Worcester, 12th century. Reproduced from R.W. Southern, Medieval Humanism, Harper & Row,
            1970, [Plate VII].
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Before the advent of the telescope, the years 1128 and 1129 provide
         the most significant evidence of sunspot observations in both the East and the West.
        Although Chinese astronomers had begun recording solar activity as early as 800 BCE, neither 
        they nor Korean astronomers produced drawings, limiting themselves to simple textual descriptions
        of the events. The first known drawing of sunspots appears in <em>The Chronicle of John of Worcester</em>
        from 1128. This medieval chronicle covers the period up to 1140 and records numerous astronomical events,
        including auroras, comets, meteor showers, as well as solar and lunar eclipses.</p>

  

    <h2 class="highlight" style="text-align: center;">But what happens in these years?</h2>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">On December 8, 1128, John of Worcester recorded in his chronicles
         the appearance of sunspots. Five days later, on the night of December 13, at Sogdo 
         (modern-day Kaesong) in Korea, astronomers observed a red vapor “rising and filling the sky” 
         from northwest to southwest. This event corresponds to an aurora borealis, appearing shortly 
         after the sunspots noted by Worcester.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="../img/Aurora_australis_panorama.jpg" alt="Aurora polare" />
        <figcaption style="text-align: justify;" >The polar aurora, often called the aurora borealis or aurora australis depending on whether
            it occurs in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere, is an optical phenomenon in the Earth’s atmosphere,
            characterized mainly by luminous bands of various shapes and colors. The image shows the aurora
            australis visible in the night sky over Swifts Creek, 100 km north of Lakes Entrance, Victoria,
            Australia.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p style="text-align: justify;" >Five days is roughly the estimated average delay between the
         appearance of a large sunspot group near the center of the Sun and the occurrence of auroras at
         relatively low latitudes. On March 22, 1129, Chinese astronomers recorded a “black spot” on the
         Sun’s surface, which disappeared on April 14. This may have been one of the sunspots observed by
         Worcester 104 days earlier, on the other side of the world.</p>

    </figure>

    <h2 class="highlight" style="text-align: center;" >The Fall of Aristotelian Dogmas</h2>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">Observing sunspots through the telescope challenged the long-standing
        notion of the Sun as a perfect celestial body and, together with other astronomical
        observations — such as the supernovae of 1572 and 1604 — called into question the immutability 
        of the heavens. These ideas had been upheld by Aristotelians, who believed that no change
        could occur in the skies, composed solely of the perfect substance, the quintessence. 
        Such observations ultimately undermined the core dogmas of Aristotelian cosmology.</p>

    <h2 class="highlight" style="text-align: center;">The Sun and Sunspots in the New Millennium</h2>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">More than four hundred years have passed since the first telescopic 
        observations, and tremendous progress has been made. Our understanding of the Sun and sunspots
        has deepened significantly, thanks both to advances in astrophysics and to the use of 
        cutting-edge satellites and telescopes.</p>

    </figure>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Today we know that sunspots are the most visible manifestation of 
        the solar magnetic field in the Sun’s visible atmosphere, and their origin is linked to an
        active dynamo in the solar convection zone. A well-developed sunspot consists of two parts: 
        a central, darker, rounded region called the <em>umbra</em>, and the surrounding <em>penumbra</em>,
        made up of radial filaments. The umbra hosts magnetic fields thousands of times stronger 
        than Earth’s magnetic field (typically 3,000–4,000 gauss). Sunspots appear dark only 
        in contrast to the much brighter surrounding regions, with the umbra at their center being 
        cooler and emitting less light than the photospheric surface. Sunspots usually appear in pairs 
        with opposite magnetic polarity and can last from less than a day to several months.</p>
